## User Experience (UX)

The goal of the website is to attract gamers of all levels who would like to compete in a game of their choice. 

There is a clear naviation in the nav bar which directs you on where to join the league or sign up to competitions. It also directs you to a tournaments gallery where they can look at pictures of tournaments others have competed in.

Users can also contact GamerLeague if they have any issues either with the site, a tournament or player - whatever it may be. They can follow the contact us link in the footer and submit their issue.

To make the user experience easy - I wanted the site to have:

* A simple call to action on the main screen with a join GamerLeague button. This will take you directly to a single contact page - Even though this navigation exists on the nav bar - the aim is this button in the center of the screen next to the tagline will motivate gamers to join. 
* A card displaying the tournaments that could be clicked on to redirect you to a the same contact page as the join button - the sign up section is on the lower part of the page. The idea is to have one single contact page that makes it a quicker and easier experience for the user.

## User Stories
To determine which approach to take with site features I detirmined the goals of different users from first time through to frequent users.
