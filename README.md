## User Experience (UX)

The goal of the website is to attract gamers of all levels who would like to compete in a game of their choice. 

There is a clear naviation in the nav bar which directs you on where to join the league or sign up to competitions. It also directs you to a tournaments gallery where they can look at pictures of tournaments others have competed in.

Users can also contact GamerLeague if they have any issues either with the site, a tournament or player - whatever it may be. They can follow the contact us link in the footer and submit their issue.

To make the user experience easy - I wanted the site to have:

* A simple call to action on the main screen with a join GamerLeague button. This will take you directly to a single contact page - Even though this navigation exists on the nav bar - the aim is this button in the center of the screen next to the tagline will motivate gamers to join. 
* A card displaying the tournaments that could be clicked on to redirect you to a the same contact page as the join button - the sign up section is on the lower part of the page. The idea is to have one single contact page that makes it a quicker and easier experience for the user.

## User Stories
To determine which approach to take with site features I detirmined the goals of different users from first time through to frequent users.

    ## Wire Frames

    When designing this website I intended the site to have a very minimal design that was easy to spot what was relevant information and how to navigate to where they wanted to be. 

    I have made some changes during the creation of the website. These changes were to the [Home Page](#home-page---wireframe-for-desktop-tablet-and-mobile), [Gallery Page](#gallery-page---wireframe-for-desktop-tablet-and-mobile) and the [Join Page](#join-page---wireframe-for-desktop-tablet-and-mobile)

### Home Page - Wireframe for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.
![An images showing the website wireframes across different devices](ux/wireframes/home-page-wireframe.png "Home Page Wireframe")

* Home page changes

For the home page I was going to initially have 3 cards showing a different game - once clicked these would take you to a page with more dummy tournaments similar to the "upcoming tournaments" section - After discussing this with my mentor we agreed it was a bit too much and to keep it simple. Instead I opted fo the multiple games to be shown in the gallery page and use the games section instead to give more identity and content to the site. I chose to do an about us section with a brief description of the team behind the site and then embedded 2 videos to give the website a professional identity. One was a tutorial from a professional coach in ESports and another was a breakdown of a recent Esports tournament on a talkshow held by retired Esports pros. I felt this would help give the site an identity of a professional gaming league.

### Gallery Page - Wireframe for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.

* Gallery page changes

During the creation of the gallery page I had intended to have a page with 3 sections showcasing tournaments for different games. When putting this together I decided I didn't like the idea of seperating the games as I wanted the gallery to be a page showcasing the GamerLeagues tournaments and work. I instead opted to make it one single pages with the images split into collumns. 3 for Desktop, 2 for Tablet and 1 for Mobile. I then showcased different Esports tournament images - the intention was to showcase the GamerLeague as a professional tournament league and the gallery can be their body of work.

### Join Page - Wireframe for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.
![An images showing the website wireframes across different devices](ux/wireframes/join-page-wireframe.png "Join Page Wireframe")

* Join Page changes

The changes for the join page were more minimal. After discussing with my mentor Mitko we agreed on having one single contact page split into sections. The top section you can join the league and the bottom you can sign up for tournaments. As I had made the dummy tournaments a "solo", "Duo" and "Squad" it would mean that the sign up form for a solo or duo would only require one or two gamertags. I thought this would look out of place so I decided to make 3 seperate fieldsets in the signup section for each different tournament type. This also then allowed me to make the gamertags a required field that all had to be filled in order to sign up.
